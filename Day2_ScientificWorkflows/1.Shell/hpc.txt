say I have a file with thousands line and process them. I can not load the file on Excel and manipulate it. It just takes too long. Using shell scripts is the best way to manupulate files in Linux. If you have multiple files with thousads of lines it takes much longer to work with them. 

mkdir
#######################awk

print
#add a culumn to a file
awk '{print NR,$1}' myfile > out
#average of a column
awk '{sum +=$1} END {if (NR>0) print sum/NR}' myfile > output.dat
######################grep
http://www.uccs.edu/~ahitchco/grep/

grep 'apple' myfile.txt
grep -i 'apple. myfile.txt  #case insensitive
grep -v 'apple' myfile.txt  #invert the search
grep -e 'apple' -e 'big' myfile.txt #also
grep -c 'apple' myfile.txt  #count lines 
grep -x 'apple' myfile.txt  #exact matches only 

#4.log file

grep ^Energy 4.log > e-test.dat

########################looping over files
for i in {1..5}; do
cat file_${i}.txt
done



#while loops
while 
   command list 1
do   
   command list
done

#example

while
((x<10))
do
echo loop $x; date >data.$x
((x=x+1))

#for loops

#####################Bash scripts
The most common used shell in Linux is called bash
https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html

bash scripts must start with #!/bin/bash

make scripts executable with chmod +x myscript.sh

run then with ./myscript


#####################SOME PROBLEMS
1. a) From 4.log file extract all lines containign 'PRESSURE' and print them in a file, out.dat
   b) Extract the third comuln of the out.dat file and print it in out-clean.dat
   c) Add a column to out-clean file and print the out put as out-time.dat
   d) Plot the data in out-time.dat with the following command
xmgrace out-time.dat

2. a) create 20 files in current directory using a 'for loop
   b) Make a bash script file that does the same job, change it's module and run it with './myscript.sh'
